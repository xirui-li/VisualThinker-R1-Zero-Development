> Training dynamics of our VisionThinker-R1-Zero training starting from the Qwen-VL-2B, without SFT or reward models. An aha moment and increasing response length is ever observed at a multimodal model.

[DeepSeek R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948) has demonstrated how Reinforcement Learning (RL) with well-designed rule-based rewards can enable a large language model to build unique reasoning capabilities autonomously. Since then, many researchers have attempted to extend this success to multimodal reasoning. However, recent efforts primarily **struggle to reproduce the increasing response length and thinking pattern** exhibited by DeepSeek R1. 

VisionThinker-R1-Zero is a replication of DeepSeek-R1-Zero training on **small multimodal** models. We are **the first** to successfully observe **the emergent ‚Äúaha moment‚Äù** and **increased response** length on **multimodal** tasks.
Through applying GRPO on the 2B base LM develops self-verification autonomously and exhibits an emergent ability to "take another look" at the image and correct its mistakes.

1. We are the **first to replicate the key characteristics** of R1 success (**‚Äùaha moment‚Äù** and **increasing reasoning length**) on **multimodal** reasoning tasks.

2. We showed that **vision-centric** tasks could also benefit from improved reasoning capabilities.  

Similar to DeepSeek R1, self reflection behavior is also observed during our RL training on vision-centric reasoning tasks. The model exhibits an emergent ability to rethink and correct its mistakes:

Therefore, dark brown wooden bed with white blanket is not above the doorway.
But wait! I can think of something else.
Maybe it's just higher than above the doorway, but slightly lower than above the doorway.

## Setup

```bash
bash setup.sh
```
## Prepare Dataset

```bash
cd src/data/SAT
bash prepare_dataset.sh
```

## Training

### GRPO Training
To reproduce the multimodal aha moment, run the following code to train the unaligned base model with GRPO on SAT:
```bash
cd src/open-r1-multimodal
bash run_grpo_SAT.sh # Adjust open-r1-multimodal/configs/zero3.yaml or zero2.yaml accordingly
```

### SFT Training
To obtain SFT model for comparison, run the following code to train the unaligned base model on SAT:
```bash
cd src/open-r1-multimodal
bash run_sft.sh # Adjust open-r1-multimodal/configs/zero3.yaml or zero2.yaml accordingly
```

## Evaluation

### CVBench Evaluation
First change to evaluation directory:
```bash
cd src/eval 
```

To evaluate Base + GRPO (VisualThinker R1 Zero) model:
```bash
python evaluate_Qwen2_VL_CVBench-base.py --model_path <path_to_your_model> \
    --bs 8 \
    --use_reasoning_prompt
```
To evaluate Base model:
```bash
python evaluate_Qwen2_VL_CVBench-base.py --model_path <path_to_your_model> \
    --bs 8 \
    --no-use_reasoning_prompt
```
To evaluate Instruct + GRPO model:
```bash
python evaluate_Qwen2_VL_CVBench.py --model_path <path_to_your_model> \
    --bs 8 \
    --use_reasoning_prompt
```
To evaluate Instruct model:
```bash
python evaluate_Qwen2_VL_CVBench.py --model_path <path_to_your_model> \
    --bs 8 \
    --no-use_reasoning_prompt
```
